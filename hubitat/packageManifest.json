  "releaseNotes": "Versions 6.1.0 - 6.0.1 (Beta)\n\nNotice, please test this new release before implmenting as many changes have been implemented in this release.\n\n1) Performance Improvement: Added new UI feature ability to select all or filter the weather data keys imported into HE.\n\n - The data key filter will allow one to select only those weather data keys needed and as a result, will reduce the number of events generated by the HE hub.\n\n2) Added a 'Clear All States' command in the AWS device UI that will remove all previous current states so that the next AWS Poll will only reflect only the active/filtered list of weather data keys. Using is optional and one only need to run this command once for cleanup.\n\n3)Removed much of the legacy SmartThings code and several device attributes that are not applicable to Hubitat.\n\n4)Changed custom AWS device driver data attributes to numeric from string (SmartThings legacy)\n\n5)Removed problematic device capabilities, Motion, Power, Energy and Water as these impacted HSM and are no longer needed.  AWS users can use WebCore/Rules to obtain same capability functionality of monitoring Rain and Wind data values imported into HE",
